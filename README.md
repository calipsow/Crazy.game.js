# JavaScript Game
## Frist project in js
 
<p><strong>This is the first milestone on my coding career started absolut from zero. Immediately after I learned the bare basics of coding I decided to manifest these skills and wrote a crazy little canvas JS game. And turns out - nobody including me will ever understand what the code actually does, but the "game" worked. - On my machine :D</strong></p>
