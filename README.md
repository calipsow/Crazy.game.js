## Frist project in js
 
<p><strong>

Its always funny to look back at your very first serious project after years and try to comprehent the codebase and realising: "Good Thanks I Stop Writing Code Line This ðŸ˜„" 
<br/>
Its the first milestone on my coding career started from absolut zero. 
<br/>
Its not about code style or anything professional its just about fun doing it; 
<br/>
- Even if nobody including myself will understand whatever i wrote, but in the end it worked and most important, i learned a lot from it.
<br/>
So Enjoy!
